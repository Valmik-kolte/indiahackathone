                Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most important and widely celebrated festivals in India.
                It is a festival of lights that symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil.
                Traditionally observed by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and some Buddhists, Diwali usually takes place in
                October or November, depending on the lunar calendar. The celebration lasts for five days, with each day
                holding unique significance. People decorate their homes with oil lamps (diyas), candles, and colorful
                rangoli designs. Fireworks light up the night sky, and families gather to exchange sweets, gifts, and
                prayers. Diwali also marks the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana, as
                told in the Ramayana. It is a time of joy, renewal, and spiritual reflection, as well as a celebration
                of prosperity and togetherness.

                Holi, often referred to as the "Festival of Colors," is a vibrant and joyful Hindu festival celebrated
                mainly in India and Nepal, as well as in many parts of the world with Indian communities. It marks the
                arrival of spring and the triumph of good over evil, commemorating the legend of Prahlad and Holika. The
                festival usually takes place in March, on the full moon day of the Hindu month Phalguna. Holi begins
                with Holika Dahan, a bonfire ritual on the night before the main celebration, symbolizing the burning
                away of evil. The next day, people gather to throw colored powders, spray water, dance, and sing in the
                streets, breaking social barriers and celebrating unity and love. Traditional sweets like gujiya and
                drinks like thandai are shared among family and friends. Holi is not only a celebration of colors but
                also of forgiveness, renewal, and the joy of life.

                Shivjayanti, also known as Shivaji Jayanti, is celebrated to mark the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati
                Shivaji Maharaj, the great Maratha warrior king and founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. Born
                on February 19, 1630, at the Shivneri Fort in Maharashtra, Shivaji Maharaj is remembered for his
                bravery, leadership, and visionary governance. He played a key role in resisting Mughal rule and
                promoting regional self-rule with a strong emphasis on justice, administration, and the welfare of his
                people. Shivjayanti is especially celebrated with great pride and enthusiasm in Maharashtra, where
                people organize processions, cultural events, and speeches to honor his legacy. Statues of Shivaji
                Maharaj are decorated, and stories of his valor are shared to inspire the younger generation. The day
                serves as a tribute to one of India‚Äôs greatest heroes and a symbol of courage, unity, and patriotism.

                Pongal is a popular harvest festival celebrated mainly in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It
                usually takes place in mid-January and marks the beginning of the Tamil month Thai. The festival lasts
                for four days and is dedicated to the Sun God, thanking nature for a bountiful harvest. The name
                "Pongal" comes from the traditional dish made from newly harvested rice, milk, and jaggery, which is
                cooked and offered to the deities as a symbol of gratitude. Each day of the festival‚ÄîBhogi, Thai Pongal,
                Mattu Pongal, and Kaanum Pongal‚Äîhas its own significance and customs, including cleaning homes,
                decorating with kolam (rangoli), and honoring cattle for their contribution to farming. People wear new
                clothes, visit relatives, and enjoy festive meals together. Pongal is a joyful celebration of
                prosperity, nature, and the bond between humans and the environment.

                <div class="festival-title">üêò Ganesh Chaturthi</div>
                Ganesh Chaturthi is a major Hindu festival celebrated to honor the birth of Lord Ganesha, the
                elephant-headed god of wisdom, prosperity, and good fortune. It usually falls in the Hindu month of
                Bhadrapada, around August or September, and is especially popular in Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and
                other parts of India. The festival begins with the installation of beautifully crafted Ganesha idols in
                homes and public pandals (temporary structures), accompanied by prayers, devotional songs, and offerings
                like modaks, which are considered Lord Ganesha‚Äôs favorite sweet. Celebrations typically last for 10
                days, with daily rituals and cultural programs. On the final day, known as Anant Chaturdashi, the idols
                are taken in grand processions and immersed in water bodies, symbolizing Ganesha‚Äôs return to Mount
                Kailash and the cycle of creation and dissolution. Ganesh Chaturthi is a vibrant and devotional festival
                that brings people together in celebration, prayer, and community spirit.
